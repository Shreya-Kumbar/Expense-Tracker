# ðŸ’°**EXPENSE-TRACKER**
- Track your expenses in a clean and neat tabular form with this python script.
- You can call any functions as you want (NOT each one of them is used in the code right now).
- Once you run the code, the expenses.csv file is created and if you wish, you can create a backup file or a copy for exporting it and give it a name (here july.csv), by calling the export functions provided in the code.
