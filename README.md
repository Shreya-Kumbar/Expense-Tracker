💰**EXPENSE-TRACKER**
<br>
-Track your expenses in a clean and neat tabular form with this python script.
<br><br>
-You can call any functions as you want (all of them are NOT used in the code right now).
<br><br>
-Once you run the code, the expenses.csv file is created and if you wish, you can create a backup file or a copy for exporting it and give it a name (here july.csv), by calling the export functions provided in the code.
